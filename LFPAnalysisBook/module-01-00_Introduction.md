# Introduction to LFP Analysis

In this Jupyter Book, I hope to provide resources for students to step through basic 
pre-processing, analysis, and statistics for analzying human electrophysiological data in Python. 

To that end, students would also benefit from perusing the following resources before 
messing around with the code contained herein. 

## Reading resources: 

[Electrophysiology basics](https://ahleighton.github.io/OE-ephys-course/EEA/theoryday1.html)

[The origin of extracellular fields and currents â€” EEG, ECoG, LFP and spikes](https://www.nature.com/articles/nrn3241)


[Advances in human intracranial electroencephalography research, guidelines and good practices](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35792291/)

[A tutorial review of functional connectivity analysis methods and their interpretational pitfalls](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/systems-neuroscience/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2015.00175/full)

## Video resources: 

[Mike X. Cohen describes time-frequency analyses in detail](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ahrcB5HL0k&list=PLn0OLiymPak2BYu--bR0ADNBJsC4kuRWs)

## Code resources: 

The material in this JupyterBook will be most easily consumed if you have already worked through and understand the material here: 

[Case Studies in Neural Data Analysis](https://mark-kramer.github.io/Case-Studies-Python/03.html)

<!-- Whether you write your book's content in Jupyter Notebooks (`.ipynb`) or
in regular markdown files (`.md`), you'll write in the same flavor of markdown
called **MyST Markdown**.
This is a simple file to help you get started and show off some syntax.

## What is MyST?

MyST stands for "Markedly Structured Text". It
is a slight variation on a flavor of markdown called "CommonMark" markdown,
with small syntax extensions to allow you to write **roles** and **directives**
in the Sphinx ecosystem.

For more about MyST, see [the MyST Markdown Overview](https://jupyterbook.org/content/myst.html). -->

<!-- ## Sample Roles and Directives

Roles and directives are two of the most powerful tools in Jupyter Book. They
are like functions, but written in a markup language. They both
serve a similar purpose, but **roles are written in one line**, whereas
**directives span many lines**. They both accept different kinds of inputs,
and what they do with those inputs depends on the specific role or directive
that is being called.

Here is a "note" directive:

```{note}
Here is a note
```

It will be rendered in a special box when you build your book.

Here is an inline directive to refer to a document: {doc}`markdown-notebooks`. -->


## Citations

<!-- You can also cite references that are stored in a `bibtex` file. For example,
the following syntax: `` {cite}`holdgraf_evidence_2014` `` will render like
this: {cite}`holdgraf_evidence_2014`.

Moreover, you can insert a bibliography into your page with this syntax:
The `{bibliography}` directive must be used for all the `{cite}` roles to
render properly.
For example, if the references for your book are stored in `references.bib`,
then the bibliography is inserted with:

```{bibliography}
``` -->
