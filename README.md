# LFPAnalysis


The general motivation for this package is that any member of the Saez or Gu lab should be able to load their raw EDF or NLX LFP data into mne, 
preprocess it, sync it to their behavioral task, and perform spectral analyses with minimal confusion. 

To that end, I am experimenting with making this a fully self-contained Python package that people can download using pip.

The LFPAnalysis folder contains functions split into separate utility libraries depending on what they do. 

The scripts folder contains notebooks of examples using the functions to process our data. 

Eventually, I will add a "data" folder with test data for people to play around with.
