    Method 1: Foster et al., 
    1. band-pass filtered from 80 to 120 Hz (ripple band) using a 4th order FIR filter.
    2. the root mean square (RMS) of the band-passed signal was calculated and smoothed using a 20-ms window
    3. ripple events were identified as having an RMS amplitude above 2.5, but no greater than 9, standard deviations from the mean
    4. detected ripple events with a duration shorter than 38 ms (corresponding to 3 cycles at 80 Hz) or longer than 500 ms, were rejected.

In addition to the amplitude and duration criteria the spectral features of each detected ripple event were examined
    5. calculate the frequency spectrum for each detected ripple event by averaging the normalized instantaneous amplitude between the onset and offset of the ripple event for the frequency range of 2â€“200 Hz.
    6. spectral amplitude was normalized to a percent change signal by applying a baseline correction at each frequency based on the mean amplitude of the entire recording for a given electrode and frequency
    7. reject events with more than one peak in the ripple band
    8. reject events where the most prominent and highest peak was outside the ripple band and sharp wave band for a frequencies > 30 Hz
    9. reject events where ripple-peak width was greater than 3 standard deviations from the mean ripple-peak width calculated for a given electrode and recording session
    10. reject events where high frequency activity peaks exceed 80% of the ripple peak height
